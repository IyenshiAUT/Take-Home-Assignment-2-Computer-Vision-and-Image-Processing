Name   : Iyenshi A.U.T.

This repository consists of the source codes and outputs of the Take Home Assignment 02 of EC7212 â€“ Computer Vision and Image Processing.

---
It demonstrates two fundamental image segmentation techniques:

1.  **Otsu's Algorithm**: An adaptive, global thresholding method used to separate an image into two classes (foreground and background).
2.  **Region Growing**: An iterative segmentation approach that groups pixels into larger regions based on a predefined similarity criterion.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate modules for each implemented algorithm, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- `pip` package manager

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IyenshiAUT/Take-Home-Assignment-2-Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing.git
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Scripts

Each part of the assignment can be run independently.
**To run the Original Image Creation:**
```bash
python "Image Creation/create_image.py"
```


**To run the Otsu's Algorithm demonstration:**
```bash
python "1 Otsu Algorithm/otsu_algorithm.py"
```

**To run the Region Growing demonstration:**
```bash
python "2 Region Growing/region_growing.py"
```

The scripts will display the resulting images on your screen and save them to the corresponding `output` directory.
